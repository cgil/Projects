This is version 2 of a hack made at Photo Hack Day 3 in San Francisco, summer of 2012.
It uses your input to find tweets and then tries to create meme's out of those tweets.
There are a lot of api calls made and a lot of images being moved around which easily
bogs down my tiny server. I stopped working on this project before I addressed these issues
making the interaction very slow.
If it's still up you can find a demo here: www.eatme.me
As I said, it takes a while to load, so be patient!
