<h1>About</h1>
The TwitPic class provides full access to the TwitPic API, including photo uploads and write-enabled API methods.

<h1>Dependencies</h1>
Due to the complexity of OAuth, there are 2 PEAR packages that are required (not counting their own dependencies):

* HTTP_OAuth
* HTTP_Request2

If anyone is interested in porting this project to remove these dependencies, feel free to fork it and give it a go.

<h1>Example Usage</h1>
Check out the file aptly named EXAMPLE.php to see how the class is used. More examples coming soon.
