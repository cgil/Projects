Public version of a few projects as source code demos:
-These are samples not complete projects and may not be up-to-date with current versions of these projects.

livecrowd:
Crowdsourcing of video feeds for 3d representation of events based on location and orientation of camera feed.
Uses an Android app to track user GPS location and Ustream API to keep 
position live video feeds around an event based on location.
-Android_GPS_APP: An Android application that runs as a service, created to 
upload your gps coordinates to our livecrowd database while using our app.

friendscope:
Application that publicly display all user's Facebook Friends and allows you to view private pictures regardless of friendship status.
This utilizes a gap in Facebook's privacy policy and the Facebook API to grab
all application user's friend's and keep active access tokens for later use.
Other information is also available.
The demo for this version is "OFF" and not available for public use.
You can browse a few previously added user's as a demo at

Blobs:
Ongoing browser based evolution simulator.
This is the initial demo as a proof of concept.
Click to add Blobs, blobs have an outer radius of "vision".
Blobs of the same color group together and move away from other
colored Blobs.
Created in Processing and translatted using Processing.js.


Contacts:
Contacts is a project created within a week. 
Contacts is an RFID reader designed to be held as a wristwatch.
Two people wearing these stylish watches can exchange contact information,
emails, or any other information with the shake of a hand.
This involves the use of an RFID reader module, RFID tags, and Zigbee module for
wifi capabilities on an integrated circuit board.
These different components talk via Arduino and are processed via Processing.
We hope to demo this later on in the year as an actual watch and using 
high frequency readers and an online database.
